Assuming that you have java.exe in the Enviroment Variables path. go to the your workspace folder 
and located the file where the .java is. Once this is located and you know the path to that file, you can execute the file by using the command prompt window. 
After that is executed a file .class will be generated. Then run this class by using the next command : java "space""Here goes the name of the class generated""space" > "name of the outfile".
That being said, it is going to look something like this. 
java Nmubers >out.txt
